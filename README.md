# Project-Exploring-NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores

This project analyzes SAT performance data from New York City public high schools. The SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. Each student receives scores in three sections—**Reading**, **Math**, and **Writing**—with a maximum of 800 points per section.

Understanding school performance on the SAT is valuable for educators, policymakers, researchers, and families looking to make informed decisions about education.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in `schools.csv` and contains SAT result data for NYC public high schools. Each row represents a single school and includes the number of test-takers along with their average scores in each SAT section.


## Note

This project was completed as part of a DataCamp project titled **"Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores."**
